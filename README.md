*A Strategic Proposal for Transforming K-12 AI Education*

## Executive Summary

The current Public Education AI policy (July 2024) is a competent, cautious document that addresses necessary concerns: data privacy, academic integrity, ethical considerations, and the need for human-AI collaboration. It references solid frameworks and acknowledges AI as an evolving area.

However, it fundamentally prepares students for 2023, not 2027.

This framework proposes a paradigm shift: from treating AI as a **tool to be managed** to treating AI fluency as a **core capability to be mastered**. The system's agility and economic need for differentiation create a unique opportunity to lead rather than follow.

The goal: Graduate students who can **orchestrate AI systems to solve real problems** while maintaining human judgment, accountability, and ethical grounding.
