# ⚠️ Critical Gaps in the Current Approach

### 1. Defensive Rather Than Empowering Framing

The policy's central question is "How do we prevent misuse?" rather than "How do we develop mastery?" This creates students who are cautious about AI rather than capable with it.

| Current Framing | Needed Framing |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Check with your teacher if AI is allowed" | "Determine when AI is optimal for this task" |
| "AI is not to be used to generate inappropriate content" | "You are accountable for everything you produce with AI" |
| "Use AI to support your education, not do the work" | "Use AI to accomplish more sophisticated work than was previously possible" |

### 2. No Vision for AI-Native Skills

The policy doesn't address the skills students will actually need:

- **Prompt Architecture**: Designing complex, multi-step instructions that produce reliable outputs
- **Agent Orchestration**: Directing AI systems that can take autonomous actions
- **Calibration Awareness**: Understanding when AI is confidently wrong
- **Verification Workflows**: Systematic approaches to validating AI outputs
- **Human-AI Task Allocation**: Knowing which parts of a problem benefit from AI vs. human-only approaches

### 3. Academic Integrity Model is Backwards

The policy treats AI assistance as a form of cheating to be detected and prevented. But in professional contexts, the skill isn't avoiding AI—it's **leveraging AI while remaining the accountable decision-maker**.

Students need to learn to be conductors, not to fear the orchestra.

### 4. No Preparation for Agentic AI

By the time current Grade 6 students enter the workforce, they'll be supervising AI systems that can:
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously
- Make decisions within defined parameters
- Coordinate with other AI agents
- Take actions in the real world (scheduling, purchasing, communicating)

The current policy doesn't prepare students to direct, supervise, or quality-check these systems.

### 5. Missing: Learning Velocity and "Just-in-Time Mastery"

The fundamental 21st-century skill isn't "knowing things"—it's learning faster than the environment changes. The current framework misses the concept of **Just-in-Time Mastery**: the ability for a student to use AI to instantaneously upskill in a new domain to solve an immediate problem. This shifts the target from "what you know" to "what you can learn and apply immediately."

### 6. The "Passive User" Trap (Technological Agency Gap)

The current policy implicitly views students as *consumers* of AI technology (or potential victims of it), rather than *creators* and *shapers* of it. If students only learn to "use" tools others build, they remain dependent. The framework must encourage students to **build their own AI workflows**, customize their own agents, and understand the "why" behind the tool's behavior, turning them from passive users into **active architects**.
