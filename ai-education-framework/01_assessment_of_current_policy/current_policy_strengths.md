# 📋 Assessment of Current Policy: Strengths

## What the Current Policy Gets Right

The July 2024 "Recommended Approaches to Generative AI" document establishes important foundations:

- **Privacy and Security**: Clear guidance on privacy compliance and data protection
- **Ethical Awareness**: Acknowledgment of bias, environmental impact, and transparency concerns
- **Framework Integration**: References to ISTE Standards, AI4K12 Big Ideas, and UDL principles
- **Living Document Approach**: Recognition that policy must evolve with technology
- **Human-AI Synergy**: Shifts focus from "human-AI balance" (a zero-sum trade-off) to **integration and amplification**. The goal is not just to keep the human in the loop for safety, but to position the learner as the **architect**—using AI as a powerful engine to orchestrate solutions they could not achieve alone.
