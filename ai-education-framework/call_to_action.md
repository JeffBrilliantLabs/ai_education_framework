# Call to Action

Public Education has a choice: adopt cautious policies that keep pace with other jurisdictions, or lead with a bold vision that prepares students for the AI-native world they will actually inhabit.

The students entering kindergarten this year will graduate in 2038. By then, AI will be as fundamental to professional work as email and spreadsheets are today—probably more so.

We can prepare them to follow. Or we can prepare them to lead.

This framework proposes that the Public Education System choose leadership.
