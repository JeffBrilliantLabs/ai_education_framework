- Teacher assessment of verification behaviors

**Middle School (6-8)**:
- AI-augmented project submissions with process documentation
- Prompt portfolio with reflection entries
- Peer assessment of AI collaboration approaches
- Case study analyses of AI applications

**High School (9-12)**:
- Complex AI-augmented projects with full documentation
- AI workflow design challenges
- Ethical analysis papers
- Real-world problem solutions with organizational partners
- Portfolio defense presentations

### Assessment as Learning
Assessment shouldn't just measure learning; it should *be* learning.
*   **HS Capstone**: Reframe from "final paper" to "built solution." The proof of mastery is that the AI tool works for a community client.
*   **Peer AI Review**: Students use AI to critique peer work *before* human review ("What did the AI miss that you caught?"), training their critical eye.
