### System Accountability

**Annual Reporting Should Include**:
- Student AI fluency progression data
- Teacher AI proficiency development
- Partnership activity and outcomes
- Equity metrics (access, outcomes by demographic)
- Adaptation log (policy/curriculum changes in response to AI evolution)

### Student Voice in Accountability
We must measure student agency from the student's perspective.
*   **The "Agency Index"**: Annual metric derived from surveys asking: "Do you feel capable of using AI to solve problems you care about?"
*   **Student Audit**: A student committee reviews this System Accountability report to validate if it matches their classroom reality.
