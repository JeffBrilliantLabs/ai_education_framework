# Assessment and Accountability

### Measuring AI Fluency: A New Assessment Model

Traditional assessments ask: "Does the student know X?"

AI fluency assessment asks: "Can the student accomplish Y using appropriate AI collaboration?"

**Assessment Principles**:

1. **Process Over Product**: How students work with AI matters as much as final output
2. **Reflection as Requirement**: Students must articulate their choices and learning
3. **Portfolio Evidence**: Growth over time, not single-point measurement
4. **Real-World Validity**: Assessments should mirror how AI is actually used professionally
5. **Adaptability**: Assessment methods must evolve as AI capabilities change

### Principle 6: Authentic Assessment ("The Un-Googleable Standard")
If a machine can do the test, the test is invalid for human assessment. We must move towards assessments requiring local context, personal experience, or novel synthesis. The **Live Defense** (oral checks) becomes more valuable than the written paper, revealing true fluency through conversation ("Why did you choose this prompt?").
