# Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Teacher Resistance or Overwhelm

**Mitigation**:
- **"Lead Learner" Expectation**: redefining teaching expertises as facilitation rather than content authority
- **Professional Development**: Extensive investment in teacher comfort/fluency

### Students as Allies
The strongest counter to teacher resistance is seeing student engagement. Use **"Reverse Classrooms"** where students demonstrate to staff how they use AI to learn. When teachers see AI not as a cheating tool but as a spark for student creativity ("Look at this business plan I built"), resistance often turns to curiosity.
