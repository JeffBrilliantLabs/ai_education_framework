# Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)

**Q1-Q2**:
- Establish AI Education Leadership Team (EECD, districts, university partners)
- Conduct teacher AI fluency baseline assessment
- Begin Tier 1 teacher professional development
- Develop provincial AI platform requirements

**Q3-Q4**:
- Launch pilot AI-augmented projects in 10 volunteer schools
- Deploy initial provincial AI platform
- Begin curriculum framework development
- **Platform R&D**: Evaluate and select initial toolset for pilot
- Establish first real-world problem partnerships

### The "Student-First" Pilot
Don't just pilot with teachers; pilot with students. Recruit 50 "Student Alpha Testers" for a high-agency track. These students can serve as **Student Tech Support** for the teachers, easing the technical burden on staff. This turns "implementation" into a shared adventure.
