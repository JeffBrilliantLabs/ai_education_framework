### Ongoing: Continuous Evolution

AI capabilities will continue advancing. This framework must evolve continuously. Build in:
- Annual curriculum review cycle
- Regular teacher development updates
- Partnership program adaptation
- Assessment model refinement
- Equity Audits: Ensuring benefits are distributed across all regions

### The Student AI Council
To ensure the framework remains relevant, establish a **Student AI Council** that meets quarterly with framework leaders. They provide the "Vibes Check"—frank feedback on what feels outdated or "cringe" effectively keeping the policy grounded in the rapidly shifting reality of youth culture and technology.
