### The Alumni Flywheel
By Phase 3, the first cohort of "Alpha Testers" will be graduates. We should recruit them as **Alumni Mentors** to return (virtually) and coach current students. Their success stories in the real world become the primary driver of student engagement, proving the value of the skills being taught. Global case studies aggressively profiling these first graduates will serve as proof of concept.
