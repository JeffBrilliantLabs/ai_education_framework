### Differentiation Opportunity

If the System implements this framework effectively, it creates:

1. **Talent Brand**: "Our graduates are AI-fluent" becomes a recognized differentiator

2. **Immigration Draw**: Families who want excellent AI education for their children have a reason to consider our system

3. **Employer Attraction**: Companies needing AI-capable workforces have reason to locate in the region

4. **Innovation Ecosystem**: AI-fluent graduates feed local startups and entrepreneurship

5. **Research Partnerships**: Universities gain K-12 collaboration opportunities for AI education research

### Retaining Builders
The goal isn't just job readiness; it is **Founder Readiness**. An AI-fluent 18-year-old can build a software company serving global clients from local innovation hubs. By fostering a **"Builder Identity"** early, we increase the likelihood that graduates will stay and create jobs here, rather than leaving to find them elsewhere.
