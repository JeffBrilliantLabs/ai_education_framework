### Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

**AI Fluency**: The ability to orchestrate AI systems effectively while maintaining human judgment and accountability. Goes beyond literacy (understanding) to mastery (skilled application).

**Agentic AI**: AI systems that can take autonomous actions, make decisions within parameters, and execute multi-step tasks without continuous human direction.

**Prompt Architecture**: The skill of designing instructions for AI systems that reliably produce intended outputs, including structure, context provision, format specification, and iterative refinement.

**Orchestration**: Directing and coordinating AI systems (potentially multiple) to accomplish complex tasks, including task decomposition, quality monitoring, and integration of outputs.

**Calibration**: Understanding the relationship between AI confidence and actual accuracy—knowing when AI is likely to be wrong even when it seems certain.

**Verification Workflow**: A systematic process for checking AI outputs against reliable sources, identifying potential errors, and confirming accuracy before use.
