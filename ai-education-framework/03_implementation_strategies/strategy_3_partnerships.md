# 🤝 Strategy 3: Real-World Problem Partnerships

**The Problem**: AI education often uses artificial exercises disconnected from actual applications.

**The Solution**: Partner with community organizations on real problems where students use AI under supervision.

**Potential Partnership Areas**:

| Sector | Partner Types | Example Projects |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Municipal Government** | Town councils, regional service commissions | AI-assisted analysis of community feedback, accessibility audit of communications |
| **Healthcare** | Local Health Networks, community clinics | Health communication clarity analysis, appointment scheduling optimization research |
| **Natural Resources** | Forestry companies, conservation groups, Dept of Natural Resources | Wildlife data analysis, forest inventory assistance, climate impact research |
| **Small Business** | Local chambers of commerce | AI-assisted market research, customer communication improvement |
| **Non-Profit** | United Way, food banks, community organizations | Volunteer coordination optimization, service gap analysis |

**Structure**:
- Organizations provide real (appropriately anonymized) challenges
- Students work in teams with teacher and organization mentor oversight
- AI use is expected and documented
- Students present findings/recommendations to organization
- Reflection on process is central to assessment

**Benefits for the System**:
- Students gain real-world experience
- Organizations get fresh perspectives and analysis capacity
- Creates connections between schools and community
- Demonstrates AI's potential for regional benefit

### Students as Consultants
This strategy positions students as the **R&D Department for the Community**, providing **Reverse Mentorship** to organizations adapting to AI. The projects are not simulations; the motivation comes from the **Real Impact** of their analysis actually being used by community partners.
