# 💻 Strategy 5: Infrastructure and Access Equity

**The Problem**: AI fluency requires access to AI tools. Unequal access creates unequal opportunity.

**The Solution**: Ensure every student in the system has equitable access to AI tools.

**Components**:

1. **System-Wide AI Platform**: A managed, age-appropriate AI environment for educational use with:
   - Privacy protections built in
   - Usage monitoring for safety
   - Equitable access regardless of family resources
   - Appropriate capability levels by grade band

2. **Connectivity Guarantee**: Reliable internet access for all students, including rural areas

3. **Device Access**: Ensuring students have appropriate devices for AI interaction

4. **Family Support**: Resources and workshops helping families understand and support AI education

### Access to Creation, Not Just Consumption
True equity means more than access to a chat interface. For older students, we must provide **API Access** to build actual applications. We should also investigate **Local AI** (running small models on school hardware) to teach students about "owning the stack," privacy, and hardware constraints.
