# 📂 Strategy 2: The AI Learner Portfolio

**The Problem**: Current approaches try to detect and punish AI use. This is increasingly impossible and educationally counterproductive.

**The Solution**: Have students build a portfolio documenting their AI collaborations over time.

**Portfolio Components**:

1. **Prompt Evolution Records**: Saved progressions showing how students refined their prompts
2. **Verification Logs**: Documentation of how students checked AI outputs
3. **Reflection Entries**: Regular reflection on what AI helped with, what it couldn't do, what the student learned
4. **Skill Progression Evidence**: Examples demonstrating growth in AI fluency over time
5. **Ethical Reasoning Samples**: Analysis of AI implications in student projects

**Benefits**:
- Creates a growth record more valuable than any single grade
- Shifts incentives from hiding AI use to demonstrating sophisticated AI use
- Produces a portfolio valuable for post-secondary applications and employment
- Makes AI fluency visible and assessable

### Portfolio as Digital Identity
The portfolio is a "User Manual for Me." It should document the student's **"AI Team"** (custom personas they have built and refined) and serve as a **Failure Resume**, explicitly documenting what *didn't* work to demonstrate resilience. Crucially, this asset must be **Portable** (e.g., a personal GitHub repo), owned by the student, not locked in a school LMS.
