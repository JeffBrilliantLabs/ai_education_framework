# 🧑‍🏫 Strategy 4: Teacher Development as Priority Investment

**The Problem**: Teachers cannot teach AI fluency if they haven't developed it themselves.

**The Solution**: Intensive, ongoing professional development that treats teachers as professionals developing expertise.

**Professional Development Model**:

**Tier 1 — Foundation (All Teachers)**:
- Basic AI fluency for personal productivity
- Understanding of AI capabilities and limitations
- Comfort using AI for lesson planning, differentiation, assessment design
- Time: 20 hours initial + ongoing monthly sessions

**Tier 2 — Integration (Teachers implementing AI curriculum)**:
- Prompt architecture for educational contexts
- AI-augmented project design and assessment
- Student AI work evaluation
- Managing AI in classroom settings
- Time: 40 additional hours + learning community participation

**Tier 3 — Leadership (AI Education Champions)**:
- Advanced AI applications
- Curriculum development
- Peer coaching and mentorship
- Research and innovation
- Time: Ongoing release time for development and coaching

**Key Principles**:
- Teachers should experience AI as learners before teaching it
- Learning communities, not one-off workshops
- Permission to experiment and fail
- Compensation for development time

### Teachers as Lead Learners
To model valid behaviors for students, teachers must practice **Transparent Learning**—admitting what they don't know and "learning out loud" with their class. Advanced students can assist in **Co-Creation**, helping design PD for teachers based on their on-the-ground experience with the tools.
