# 🏗️ Pillar 4: Orchestration & Supervision

**What it means**: The ability to direct AI systems (including autonomous agents) while maintaining accountability for outcomes.

**Grade Band Progression**:

| Grade Band | Skills | Example Activities |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| K-2 | Understanding sequences of instructions | Programming simple robots (Bee-Bots, etc.) with multi-step commands |
| 3-5 | Monitoring automated processes | Set up simple automations, observe and report on outcomes |
| 6-8 | Multi-step AI workflows | Create a research project using AI for multiple stages (brainstorming → outline → draft → revision) |
| 9-12 | Agent supervision, intervention decisions | Design AI agent instructions for a task, define success criteria, determine when human intervention is needed |

**Assessment**: Students design an AI workflow for a real task, implement it, document outcomes, and reflect on what they would change.

### Key Concept: Systems Leadership
This prepares students for management roles by adopting a **"Managerial Stance."** Even young students can act as "Project Managers" with AI agents as "Interns." This shifts the student's value from execution to **vision and quality control**, reinforcing the "Architect" metaphor where they design the systems that deliver the work, achieving 10x leverage.
