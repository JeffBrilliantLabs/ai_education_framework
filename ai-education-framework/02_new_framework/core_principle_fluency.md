# 🧠 A New Framework for AI Education

## Core Principle: From AI Literacy to AI Fluency

**AI Literacy** (current goal): Students understand what AI is, recognize its limitations, and use it responsibly.

**AI Fluency** (proposed goal): Students can orchestrate AI systems to solve complex problems, maintain accountability for AI-assisted work, and continuously adapt as AI capabilities evolve.

### The Five Pillars of AI Fluency

This transition requires a core identity shift: from "student completing assignments" to **"project lead managing resources."** We define the **AI-Native Learner** not just as someone who uses AI, but as someone who views AI as a *plastic medium* they can mold. They do not just adapt (react); they orchestrate (proact).
