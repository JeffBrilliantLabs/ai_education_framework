# 🕵️‍♀️ Pillar 2: Verification & Calibration

**What it means**: The ability to assess AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and appropriateness—and to understand when AI confidence doesn't equal correctness.

**Grade Band Progression**:

| Grade Band | Skills | Example Activities |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| K-2 | Understanding that AI can make mistakes | "Spot the silly mistake" games with AI-generated content |
| 3-5 | Basic fact-checking against sources | Verify 5 AI claims using library/internet resources |
| 6-8 | Systematic verification workflows, recognizing confident errors | Create a verification checklist for AI research assistance |
| 9-12 | Statistical reasoning about AI reliability, understanding training data limitations | Analyze domains where AI performs well vs. poorly, investigate why |

**Assessment**: Given an AI-generated document with planted errors (and some correct content), students must identify issues and explain their verification methodology.

### Key Concept: Epistemic Agency
Verification is not just "catching the AI being wrong"; it is establishing the student as the **Arbiter of Truth**. We operate on the **"Editor-in-Chief" model**: the student puts their name on the byline, owning every word regardless of origin. This reinforces the principle of **"Verify then Trust,"** treating AI output as raw material that gains value only through the student's rigorous vetting process.
