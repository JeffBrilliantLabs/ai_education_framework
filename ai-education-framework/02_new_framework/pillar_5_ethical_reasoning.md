# ⚖️ Pillar 5: Ethical Reasoning & Accountability

**What it means**: The ability to reason about ethical implications of AI use and maintain personal accountability for AI-assisted work.

**Grade Band Progression**:

| Grade Band | Skills | Example Activities |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| K-2 | Fairness concepts, understanding that AI reflects human choices | Discussions about fair vs. unfair rules, who decides how AI works |
| 3-5 | Bias recognition, privacy awareness | Examine AI recommendations for patterns, discuss what information should stay private |
| 6-8 | Stakeholder analysis, unintended consequences | Case studies of AI deployments, identify who benefits and who might be harmed |
| 9-12 | Ethical frameworks application, accountability structures | Design governance for an AI system, create accountability documentation for AI-assisted projects |

**Assessment**: Ethical reasoning is embedded in all AI-assisted projects through required reflection components.

### Key Concept: Moral Agency
Ethics is a leadership capability, not just a constraint checklist. We position the student as the **Moral Agent** who decides how their AI tools should behave ("If you were designing the guardrails, what would they be?"). Students act as **Bias Detectives** and take absolute ownership: "You are responsible for the robot." This moves accountability from passive ("The AI did it") to active ("I allowed my AI to do it").
