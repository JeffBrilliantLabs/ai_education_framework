# 🤝 Pillar 3: Human-AI Task Allocation

**What it means**: The judgment to determine which parts of a problem benefit from AI assistance, which require human-only work, and how to integrate both.

**Grade Band Progression**:

| Grade Band | Skills | Example Activities |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| K-2 | Recognizing tasks humans do vs. computers do | Sorting activities into "human job" vs. "computer job" categories |
| 3-5 | Understanding AI strengths (pattern recognition, speed) and limitations (judgment, creativity, physical tasks) | Design a project identifying which parts AI could help with |
| 6-8 | Strategic task decomposition | Break a complex project into AI-assisted and human-only components with justification |
| 9-12 | Optimization of human-AI workflows | Design and test different human-AI collaboration models for the same task, measure outcomes |

**Assessment**: Students present a task analysis showing their allocation decisions and reasoning.

### Key Concept: Strategic Delegation
This "executive" skill requires students to know their own strengths. We teach **Agency in Design**: students choose what to delegate based on what brings them joy or growth ("The Joy of the Hard Parts"). Students should map tasks not just by "Can AI do it?" but **"Does doing this myself help me grow?"** This ensures delegation is a strategic choice, not an avoidance mechanism.
