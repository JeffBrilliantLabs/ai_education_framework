# 🗣️ Pillar 1: Prompt Architecture & Communication

**What it means**: The ability to communicate precisely with AI systems to achieve intended outcomes.

**Grade Band Progression**:

| Grade Band | Skills | Example Activities |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| K-2 | Understanding that instructions must be clear and specific | Giving directions to a "robot friend" (another student), observing how ambiguity causes confusion |
| 3-5 | Basic prompt structure, iteration based on results | Using AI to help write stories, learning to ask follow-up questions when output isn't right |
| 6-8 | Multi-step prompts, role assignment, format specification | Creating AI-assisted research reports with explicit methodology instructions |
| 9-12 | Complex prompt chains, system prompts, few-shot examples, prompt debugging | Designing prompt templates for recurring tasks, analyzing why prompts fail |

**Assessment**: Students submit prompt portfolios showing iteration from initial attempt to successful output, with reflection on what changes improved results.

### Key Concept: Metacognitive Prompting
Prompt architecture is a rigorous exercise in clear thinking. We teach the **"Mirror Effect"**: if the AI is confused, the student's instructions were likely unclear. This puts the power back on the student to debug their own thinking. Mastery moves beyond "giving commands" to **"designing personas,"** enabling students to architect their own learning environments (e.g., building a "Socratic Tutor" for themselves).
